# Risk Profile: Story 1.2

Date: 2026-01-16
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 78/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Page Load Speed > 1s

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - While Next.js is fast, the strict <1s target requires careful optimization of assets and zero bloat.
**Impact**: High - Directly impacts conversion and SEO, which are core goals of Epic 1.
**Mitigation**:
- Use `next/image` for all visual assets.
- Monitor bundle size strictly.
- Pre-render static parts of the landing page.
**Testing Focus**: Lighthouse performance audits, Core Web Vitals monitoring, and throttled network testing (3G/4G).

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                 | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001 | Page Load Speed > 1s                        | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Next.js 16/Tailwind 4 Bleeding Edge Issues  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| UX-001   | Layout Shift (CLS) on dynamic CTA/Selector  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | User Friction from lack of navigation menu  | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| SEC-001  | Invalid/Malicious 'topic' query param       | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Automate Lighthouse CI to fail if performance score < 95 or LCP > 1.2s.
- **Visual Regression**: Ensure "Zero Distraction" UI renders correctly on various screen sizes (375px to 1440px).

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Specifically test Tailwind 4 rendering on Safari/Firefox/Chrome (latest versions).
- **Layout Shift Testing**: Monitor CLS during simulated clicks on the Hero CTA.

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests
- **Navigation Validation**: Test `/quiz?topic=invalid` and ensure the application handles it gracefully (defaulting or redirecting).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-001 (Must meet < 1.5s real-world LCP).
- TECH-001 (No console errors or CSS injection failures).

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- UX-001 (Minimal shift < 0.1 accepted).
- BUS-001 (Accept bounce risk for MVP as per product strategy).

## Monitoring Requirements
- Vercel Analytics for real-world Core Web Vitals.
- Error tracking (Sentry) for runtime JS errors related to the new stack.
