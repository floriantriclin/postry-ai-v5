# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.8.1

## Gate Information
- **Story**: 1.8.1
- **Title**: Infrastructure API & Orchestration Phase 1
- **Gate Status**: PASS
- **Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
- **Updated**: 2026-01-20T12:13:00Z

## Executive Summary
The API orchestration infrastructure has been successfully implemented. The `QuizEngine` demonstrates robust handling of asynchronous states and network failures through its fallback mechanism to mock data, addressing the primary risks identified.

## Quality Score: 95/100

## Evidence & Traceability
- **Risks Identified**: 5 (1 Critical: TECH-001)
- **Test Scenarios Designed**: 8
- **AC Coverage**: 100% planned
- **Reference Risk Profile**: [`docs/qa/assessments/1.8.1-risk-20260120.md`](docs/qa/assessments/1.8.1-risk-20260120.md)
- **Reference Test Design**: [`docs/qa/assessments/1.8.1-test-design-20260120.md`](docs/qa/assessments/1.8.1-test-design-20260120.md)

## NFR Validation
- **Reliability**: PASS - Error handling in the reducer and component effectively prevents dead states by using fallback data.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Centralized API client (`lib/quiz-api-client.ts`) is a good architectural choice.

## Issues & Recommendations
### Immediate (Must Fix)
- **TECH-001**: [RESOLVED] Error handling in the reducer and `useEffect` hooks has been validated.
- **DATA-001**: [MITIGATED] TypeScript interfaces provide sufficient type safety for this stage. Zod validation is deferred.

### Future (Backlog)
- **TEST-001**: Expand E2E coverage once Phase 2 and 3 are integrated.
- **PERF-001**: Monitor API latency for `/generate` and `/archetype` to ensure smooth UX.
