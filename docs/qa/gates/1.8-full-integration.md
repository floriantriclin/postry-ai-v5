# Quality Gate: Story 1.8 - Full Quiz Integration

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Story** | 1.8 |
| **Title** | Intégration Complète du Quiz Dynamique (Frontend) |
| **Gate Status** | **PASS** |
| **Reviewer** | Quinn (Test Architect) |
| **Date** | 2026-01-20 |
| **Quality Score** | 90/100 |

## Status Reason
Story is well-defined with clear integration points, performance optimizations (prefetching), and fallback mechanisms. Risks are identified and mitigated via testing tasks.

## Top Issues
| ID | Title | Severity | Owner | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ISS-001 | High state complexity (Race Conditions) | Medium | Dev | Requires careful reducer implementation to handle background prefetch. |
| ISS-002 | Lack of 429 Error Handling | Low | Dev | LLM APIs may trigger rate limits; fallback should handle this. |

## NFR Validation
- **Security**: PASS - Standard API calls, no sensitive data handling.
- **Performance**: CONCERNS - Real-world LLM latency might impact "Snap" feel despite prefetching.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Strong fallback to `mock-quiz.json`.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Good separation of concerns in the plan.

## Recommendations
### Immediate (Must Fix)
- Ensure reducer handles "Action out of order" scenarios for background prefetch.
- Validate that the `mock-quiz.json` fallback covers all 4 main endpoints.

### Future / Nice to Have
- Upgrade local persistence from "Recommended" to "Required" for better UX.
- Add a "Syncing..." visual indicator for `/refine` calls if they take too long (> 2s).

## Evidence
- **Tests Planned**: 9 (Unit + Integration + E2E)
- **Risks Identified**: 5
- **AC Coverage**: 100% planned
- **Test Design**: [`docs/qa/assessments/1.8-test-design-20260120.md`](docs/qa/assessments/1.8-test-design-20260120.md)
