## Executive Summary
The UX robustness and visual identity objectives for Story 1.8.3 have been fully met. The `LoaderMachine` successfully establishes the "Tech & Brut" aesthetic, and the `useQuizPersistence` hook provides a seamless recovery mechanism for user sessions. E2E tests confirm that progress is preserved across reloads and that the system alerts users correctly during API failures.
