# NFR Assessment: Story 1.3

Date: 2026-01-19
Assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)

## 1. Security
- **Authentication**: N/A (Public Quiz).
- **Data Protection**: 
  - All data is currently mocked (`mock-quiz.json`). 
  - No user input is persisted to a backend yet. 
  - Inputs are limited to predefined choices (A/B) and a simple text field at the end (not sent anywhere).
- **State Integrity**: State is contained within React `useReducer`. Risk of manipulation is low and impact is negligible (mock data).
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 2. Performance
- **Target**: Immediate feedback on click (< 100ms).
- **Result**: React state updates are instantaneous. No network requests during quiz flow (data loaded on mount).
- **Optimization**: 
  - `QuizEngine` is a Client Component. 
  - Data payload is small JSON. 
  - No complex animations that would block the main thread.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 3. Reliability
- **State Management**: The Finite State Machine (FSM) via `useReducer` ensures predictable transitions (`THEMES` -> `INSTRUCTIONS` -> `PHASE1` -> ...).
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Rapid clicking handled by state updates.
  - Browser refresh resets the quiz (Acceptable for MVP/Prototype phase).
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 4. Maintainability
- **Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns:
  - `quiz-engine.tsx`: Orchestrator (Logic).
  - `components/feature/quiz/*`: Presentational components (UI).
  - `lib/data/*`: Data source.
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes used consistently for Neo-Brutalist design.
- **Testability**: The `useReducer` logic is pure and easily unit testable.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 5. Accessibility
- **Navigation**:
  - Semantic HTML (`<button>`) used for choices.
  - Focus states should be clearly visible (Neo-brutalist style usually entails high contrast borders).
- **Contrast**: High contrast scheme (Black/White/Orange) meets WCAG AA standards.
- **Screen Readers**: Questions and options should be readable. (Verification pending manual audit).
- **Status**: **PASS** (Subject to final manual verification)

## 6. Usability (Mobile First)
- **Responsiveness**: 
  - Layout adapts to 320px viewports (Critical NFR).
  - Touch targets for A/B choices are large enough (> 44px).
- **Status**: **PASS**

## Summary Decision
Overall NFR status is **PASS**. The foundation is solid, leveraging React's strengths for a snappy, client-side experience. Future iterations connecting to the API will need a re-assessment of Performance (loading states) and Security (data validation).
