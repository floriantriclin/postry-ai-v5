**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Gatekeeper:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

The "Quiz UI Foundation" story has passed all quality checks. The implementation delivers a robust, mobile-responsive quiz engine with smooth state transitions and faithful adherence to the Neo-Brutalist design system.

### Key Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** 100% of defined scenarios executed.
- **Pass Rate:** 100% (6/6 Unit, 3/3 E2E).
- **Critical Defects:** 0
- **High Risks:** Mitigated.

## Validation Details

### 1. Functional Testing (Automated)
| Type | Suite | Tests | Result | Notes |
|Data | `components/feature/quiz/quiz-engine.test.ts` | 6 | ✅ PASS | Verified State Machine transitions, Index logic, and Reset capability. |
| E2E | `e2e/quiz.spec.ts` | 3 | ✅ PASS | Validated full User Journey (Theme -> Reveal) on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit. |

### 2. Risk Verification
- **TECH-002 (State Logic Flaws):** 
  - *Mitigation:* Unit tests confirm the `useReducer` correctly handles all state boundaries (`PHASE1` -> `TRANSITION` -> `PHASE2`).
  - *Status:* Closed.
- **UX-002 (Mobile Layout Breakage):**
  - *Mitigation:* Visual verification performed on Mobile Viewport (375x812).
  - *Observation:* Grid adapts to 2 columns, typography scales correctly, no horizontal overflow.
  - *Status:* Closed.

### 3. Visual & UX Quality
- **Design System:** Neo-Brutalist elements (borders, shadows) are consistent.
- **Responsiveness:** Validated on Desktop (900px) and Mobile (375px).
- **Performance:** Transitions are instant (Client-side state).

## Deliverables Checklist
- [x] `lib/data/mock-quiz.json` & `themes.json` created.
- [x] `QuizEngine` & Sub-components implemented.
- [x] Route `/quiz` accessible.
- [x] Unit & E2E Tests committed and passing.

## Recommendations
- **Next Step:** Proceed to Story 1.4 (ICE Core Logic).
- **Observation:** The "Loading" state is currently a simple timeout. Ensure this is replaced by real API calls in Story 1.6 without breaking the UX.
