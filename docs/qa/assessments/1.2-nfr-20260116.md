# NFR Assessment: Story 1.2

Date: 2026-01-16
Assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)

## 1. Security
- **Authentication**: N/A (Public Landing Page).
- **Authorization**: N/A.
- **Data Protection**: Theme selection passed via URL query param. No PII involved.
- **Input Validation**: `encodeURIComponent` used for query params. Standard Next.js protection against XSS in JSX.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 2. Performance
- **Target**: LCP < 1s, CLS < 0.1.
- **Result**: PASSED (Manual verification).
- **Optimization**: Minimal bundle size, static fonts via `next/font`, no large images.
- **Risk**: Manual verification is prone to regression. Automated gating recommended.
- **Status**: **PASS** (with monitoring recommendation)

## 3. Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Navigating to `/quiz` with an invalid topic is handled by the quiz component (future story) or results in a safe default. Landing page itself has no complex failure modes.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 4. Maintainability
- **Code Clarity**: Component logic is straightforward.
- **Design System Adherence**: Tailwind 4 implementation is clean and reusable via `@layer components`.
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## 5. Accessibility
- **Target**: WCAG AA.
- **Check**: Focus states (orange) are visible. Contrast ratios between Carbon Black and Paper White are excellent.
- **Status**: **PASS**

## Summary Decision
Overall NFR status is **PASS**. The primary concern remains the strict performance budget which requires automated enforcement to remain viable as the project scales.
