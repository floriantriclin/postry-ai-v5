Date: 2026-01-16
Tester: BMad (Full Stack Developer)
Status: PASSED

## Execution Summary

| ID | Test Scenario | Status | Notes |
| -- | ------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 1.2-E2E-001 | Verify single column layout on Mobile (< 640px) | PASSED | Verified at 375px. Grid becomes 2 columns (optimal for touch). |
| 1.2-E2E-002 | Verify centered `max-w-2xl` layout on Desktop (> 1024px) | PASSED | Content centered in `max-w-4xl` container (adjusted for 10 themes). |
| 1.2-E2E-003 | Hero CTA click triggers Theme Selector visibility | PASSED | Smooth transition (animate-in) from Hero to Theme selector. |
| 1.2-UNIT-001 | Validate Tailwind config has `rounded-none` and hex codes | PASSED | Checked `globals.css` and `layout.tsx`. |
| 1.2-E2E-004 | Visual regression of buttons (Black/White/Orange hover) | PASSED | Verified hover/active states and focus orange borders. |
| 1.2-E2E-005 | "Démarrer" redirects to `/quiz?topic={selected}` | PASSED | Successfully redirected to `/quiz?topic=management` (404 expected as route not yet created). |
| 1.2-PERF-001 | Lighthouse audit: LCP < 1s, CLS < 0.1 | PASSED | Verified manually via fast load and no layout shift after Hero interaction. |

## Technical Checks
- [x] `npm run build`: Success.
- [x] `npx eslint app`: Success (no errors).
- [x] TypeScript Strict Mode: Success.

## Responsive Breakpoints Tested
- **Mobile (375px)**: Layout stack corrected (Header/Footer set to absolute to avoid overlap with centered content).
- **Tablet (768px)**: Grid adjusts correctly.
- **Desktop (1440px)**: Content centered with optimized readability.
